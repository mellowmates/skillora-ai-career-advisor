## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the Skillora prototype running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- A Google Gemini API Key

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mellowmates/skillora-ai-career-advisor.git
cd skillora-ai-career-advisor
```

### 2. Set up a Virtual Environment

It's a best practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

**For Windows:**

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all the necessary Python libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Your API Key

Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project folder. This file will securely store your API key.

Open the `.env` file and add the following line, replacing `your_actual_api_key_here` with your real Gemini API key:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

Note: An `env.example` file is included in the repo with the expected environment variable names. You can copy it to `.env` and fill in your actual key. Storing API keys in `.env` is convenient for local development but not recommended for production; consider using a secrets manager or CI/CD secrets instead.

Creating `.env` (recommended local workflow)

1. Copy the example file into `.env`:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` and paste your real Gemini API key (or use an editor):

```bash
nano .env
# or
code .env
```

3. (Optional) Run the app without a `.env` file by exporting the variable in your shell instead:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
python app.py
```

Important: The repository's `.gitignore` already lists `.env`, so your file will be ignored. Do NOT commit real API keys. For production, use a secrets manager or configure environment variables in your deployment pipeline.

### 5. Run the Application

You are now ready to start the Flask application.

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Open this address in your web browser to see the prototype in action.
